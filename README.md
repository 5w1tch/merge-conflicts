This package detects the conflict markers left by `git merge` and overlays a set of controls for resolving each and navigating among them. Additionally, it displays your progress through a merge.

## Roadmap

These are the major features that I'd consider necessary for the package to be basically useful:

 * Identification of conflict markers. :white_check_mark:
 * Superimpose conflict resolution controls. :white_check_mark:
 * Resolve conflicts as either side, directly. :white_check_mark:
 * Resolve conflicts by editing in place.
 * Navigation among conflict markers within a file.
 * Keymap entries for resolution and navigation.
 * Show resolution progress for each file.
 * Minify and restore the conflict panel.
 * Save and stage changes for each file on completion.
